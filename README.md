## Description & Disscusion of the Background

Jakarta is the capital and largest city of Indonesia. Situated on the northwest coast of the world's most populous island of Java, it is the centre of economy, culture and politics of Indonesia with a population of more than ten million as of 2014. Albeit only covers 699.5 square kilometres, the smallest among any Indonesian provinces, its metropolitan area covers 6,392 square kilometres; it is the world's second most populous urban area after Tokyo, with a population of about 30 million as of 2010. Jakarta's business opportunities, as well as its potential to offer a higher standard of living, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures. The city proper has a very high population density of 14,464 people per square kilometer, while the metro area has a density of 4,383 people/sq km. [1]

Not only Jakarta residents, Jakarta is filled with workers from outside Jakarta every day, so it is often called Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi) or Greater Jakarta area. Lots of public transportation makes it easy for these workers to go to Jakarta even though the distance is quite far adrift. Therefore, there are a lot of investors who have started investing in the Jabodetabek area, and this study will try to explore parts of Jabodetabek related to relatively low property prices with low intensity of business competition. 

When we consider all of these problems, we can create a map and information chart where the house price index is placed on Jabodetabek and each district is clustered according to the venue density.

## Data Description

To consider the problem we can list the datas as belows

* I used **Forsquare API** to get the most common venues of given cities of Jabodetabek [2].
* There are not too many public datas related to demographic and social parameters for the cities of Jabodetabek. Therefor you must set-up your own data tables in most cases. In this case, I collected latest House Price Averages for each Cities of Jabodetabek from housing retail web page [3].
